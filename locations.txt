Monster;As you draw clearer, you spot a group of shoddily-dressed ruffians.  Three are dancing around a campfire singing a song about pretty barmaid.  Two others are engaged in a game of horseplay with their swords in hand.   Their footwork clearly shows they’re drunk as skunks.  But the ringing of their swords as they strike and parry suggests strength and finesse that only comes with experience.;You catch the smell of campfire and cooking.  You hear drunken revere and the clashing of swordplay.  ;M;Y
